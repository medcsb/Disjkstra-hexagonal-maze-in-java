# Dijkstra Hexagonal Maze in Java

A school project for learning Java, where I created a maze-solving game using Dijkstra's algorithm. This is my very first Java project, with a basic UI—nothing fancy, but it works!

You can create a maze by setting the height and width, then painstakingly place walls one by one (I know, it’s a pain). Once you’ve set the start and end points, hit the "Solve Maze" button to find the solution!

## How to Install

Idk man it's Java, so it should work on any platform—*code once, run everywhere*, right? ;)

But in case you need some guidance:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. **Run the Program**: Since this project is built using plain Java and Swing, you should be able to compile and run it directly from the command line or your preferred IDE.
   - **Command line**: Navigate to the project folder and compile the code with `javac Main.java`, then run it with `java Main`.
   - **IDE**: Simply open the project in your preferred IDE, build, and run.

## How to Use

- Right-click any cell to change its type.
- For walls and empty cells, I've made it "easier" to set them: select the Wall button at the bottom, and now every cell you click will turn into a wall.

## To-Do

- Probably never going to touch this again.
- Improve the UI.
- Add click-and-drag functionality to make maze creation less tedious.
- Add other pathfinding algorithms (A*, DFS, BFS).
