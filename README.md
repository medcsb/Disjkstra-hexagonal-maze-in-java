# Disjkstra-hexagonal-maze-in-java
A school project for initiation in java in wich icreated a maze solving game using dijkstra's algorithm
This is my very first Java project, with terrible UI but at least it works.

You just create a maze, set the hight and the width.
Then painstaicingly place walls one by one (I know it's a pain), set the end and the start then hit the solve maze button

## How to Install :
Idk it's java man, it's supposed to be code once run everywhere ;)

## How to use :
- you can right click any cell to change its type
- For wall and empy cells I made it "easy" to set them, you just click the wall button on the bottom and now every cell you touch becomes wall


## TO DO :
- Probably never going to touch this again
- make better ui
- click and drag (so that you can basically draw the maze you want)
- Add other algorithms (A*, DFS, BFS)
